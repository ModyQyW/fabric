# What is @modyqyw/fabricï¼Ÿ

@modyqyw/fabric is opinionated shareable specification for different JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## What is included?

@modyqyw/fabric includes everything I can think of, including naming, Git, coding styles, code quality, code formatting, automation, etc.

## Why create this project?

I'm tired of configuring project specifications over and over again, and I really need an All-in-one specification. I hope @modyqyw/fabric also saves you time configuring and allows you to move quickly.
