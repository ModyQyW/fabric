# Deployment

Experience has proven that automated deployment is the best choice for deployment.

For both service provider-hosted and self-hosted Git projects, you can use the services provided by your service provider, or automate deployment using [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com?referralCode=ModyQyW), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), etc. to automate deployment.

In addition to this, you may need to use conventionally commit-related tools to complement the capabilities offered by your service provider. Here are some options.
