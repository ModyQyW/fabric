# Overview

Best practices are good practices that have produced significant results elsewhere and can be applied here. Creating and implementing best practices increases productivity, reduces work costs, and enhances knowledge.

The process of creating this library was the creation of my own personal best practices, and by using this library I am implementing best practices. There are also some best practices that are difficult to include in this library, and this section will address those best practices to the extent possible.
