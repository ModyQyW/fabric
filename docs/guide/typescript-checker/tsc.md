# tsc

::: tip Other options
[ezno](https://github.com/kaleidawave/ezno) å’Œ [stc](https://stc.dudy.dev/) are the up-and-comers. You might consider using them if you think tsc is slow, but you'll need to configure them yourself. Be careful: they are not 100% compatible with tsc and you may get unexpected results.
